Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists. The data in both lists
will be sorted in ascending order. Change the next pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list 
which also has data in ascending order. Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the
corresponding list is empty.

Node mergeLists(Node headA, Node headB) {
     // This is a "method-only" submission. 
     // You only need to complete this method 
    
        if(headA==null && headB ==null)
            return null;
        else if(headA == null)
            return headB;
        else if(headB == null)
            return headA;
        
        if(headA.data <= headB.data)
            headA.next = mergeLists(headA.next, headB);
        else
        {
            Node temp = headB;
            headB = headB.next;
            temp.next = headA;
            headA = temp;
            headA.next = mergeLists(headA.next, headB);
        }
        return headA;
